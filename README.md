# Log Parser Analysis Report

## Overview
This takes Botify CSV exports of the log file analyzer and compares the differences between the two.

In this specific example it takes a week in September over a week in August to determine if there's a dropped crawl rate on a specific segment. We found that internal fix decreased crawls to an old product section by over 80%.

## Roadmap
1. Add in filters for additional clients and customization in the output.
2. Add in visuals to the report analysis and pivot tables. 
3. Add in features to parse by segment and review in a UI prior to generation.
4. Add in commas for numbers.
